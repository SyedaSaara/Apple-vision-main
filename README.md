# Apple Vision clone
Apple Version Clone is a project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that replicates a simplified version of the Apple website. In this project, I've defined the structure of the webpage using HTML, applied styling with CSS, and added interactive elements using JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to help understand and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
